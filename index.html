                        positive attitude, a positive self-image, and a healthy lifestyle. In this article, I share 45
                        tips
                        to live a healthier life. Bookmark this post and save the tips, because they will be vital to
                        living
                        a healthier life. :)</p>
                    <p class="p5">1. <b>Drink more water</b>. Most of us don’t drink enough water every day. Water is
                        essential for our bodies to function. Do you know over 60% of our body is made up of water?
                        Water is needed to carry out body functions, remove waste, and carry nutrients and oxygen around
                        our body. Since we lose water daily through urine, bowel movements, perspiration, and breathing,
                        we need to replenish our water intake.</p>
                    <p class="p6">Furthermore, drinking water helps in losing weight. A Health.com study carried out
                        among overweight or obese people showed that water drinkers lose 4.5 more pounds than a control
                        group! The researchers believe that it’s because drinking more water helps fill your stomach,
                        making you less hungry and less likely to overeat.</p>
                    <p class="7">The amount of water we need is dependent on various factors such as humidity, your
                        physical activity, and your weight, but generally, we need 2.7-3.7 liters of water intake per
                        day.[2] Since food intake contributes about 20% of our fluid intake, that means we need to drink
                        about 2.0-3.0 liters of water or about 8-10 glasses (now you know how the 8 glasses
                        recommendation came about!). One way to tell if you’re hydrated — your urine should be slightly
                        yellow. If it’s not, like it’s dark yellow or even orange, you’re not getting enough water!
                        Other signs include dry lips, dry mouth, and little urination. Go drink some water first before
                        you continue this article!</p>
                    <p class="p8">2. <b> Get enough sleep</b>. When you don’t rest well, you compensate by eating more.
                        Usually,
                        it’s junk food. Get enough rest and you don’t need to snack to stay awake. Also, lack of sleep
                        causes premature aging and you don’t want that</p>
                    <p class="p9">3. <b>Still Meditation or Mindfulness Meditation — </b> by focusing your attention
                        on an object or process, such as your breathing, a flame, a mantra, a visualization, music, etc.
                        An open focus is maintained. This means even though you are concentrating on something, you keep
                        an open awareness of everything else that is happening around you and inside your mind.
                        <br>
                        <b>Moving or Walking Meditation — </b> awareness through using simple repetitive steps. Some
                        examples are Tai Chi, yoga or even simple walking exercises. <br>
                        <b>Concentration Meditation — </b> is usually practised in religions. It is similar to
                        mindfulness
                        meditation with 2 differences (1) you concentrate on a religious prayer (2) you are required to
                        maintain a closed focus where you close your awareness off from anything other than the prayer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. <b>Exercise. Movement is life.</b> Research has shown that exercising daily brings tremendous
                        benefits
                        to our health, including an increase in lifespan, lowering of risk of diseases, higher bone
                        density, and weight loss. Increase the activity in your life. Choose walking over transport for
                        close distances. Climb the stairs instead of taking the lift. Join an aerobics class or a dance
                        class. Pick a sport of your liking
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. <b>Pick exercises that you enjoy.</b> When you enjoy a sport, you naturally want to do it.
                        Exercise
                        isn’t about suffering and pushing yourself; it’s about being healthy and having fun at the same
                        time. Adding variation in your exercises will keep them interesting. What exercises do you like
                        and how can you include them in your routine?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. <b>Work out different parts of your body.</b> Don’t just do cardio (like jogging). Give your
                        body a
                        proper workout. The easiest way is to engage in sports since they work out different muscle
                        groups. Popular activities where you can get a good body workout are trekking, hiking, swimming,
                        basketball, tennis, squash, badminton, yoga, and frisbee.

                        7. <b>Eat fruits.</b> Fruits have a load of vitamins and minerals. Do you know that oranges
                        offer more
                        health benefits than vitamin C pills? As much as possible, consume your vitamins and minerals
                        through your diet rather than through pills. I eat a variety of fruits every morning and they
                        energize me. Satisfy your palate with these nutritious fruits: Banana, Papaya, Kiwi,
                        Strawberries, Blueberries, Blackberries, Raspberries, Watermelon, Rockmelon, Honeydew, Peach,
                        Apple, Grapefruit, Pomelo, Mango, Orange.

                        8. <b>Eat vegetables.</b> Vegetables are the source of many nutrients and minerals like folate,
                        vitamin K,
                        folate, vitamin A, manganese, and potassium, not to mention dietary fiber which is important for
                        good gut health. There are two types of vegetables: Starchy vegetables like potato, sweet
                        potato, yam, and pumpkin; and non-starchy vegetables like kale, arugula, spinach, broccoli,
                        brussels sprouts, long beans, tomato, cucumber, and mushroom (technically a fungus). Some
                        vegetables are slightly starchy and hence fall in the middle: Corn, green peas, carrot,
                        artichoke, beetroot, cauliflower, and beans (technically legumes). All vegetables are important
                        and enrich our diet. <br>
                        I typically have raw salads for lunch every day with a variety of vegetables, then a cooked
                        dinner with grains, potatoes/sweet potatoes, and other delicious vegetables. You want to have a
                        variety of vegetable intake to strengthen your immune system

                        9. <b>Pick different-colored fruits/vegs.</b> Always consume a wide variety of fruits and
                        vegetables of
                        different colors. Firstly, fruits and vegetables with different colors represent different
                        anti-oxidant content, which removes free radicals that damage our cells and fights inflammation
                        in our body. Secondly, when we eat a large diversity of fruits/vegetables, it creates a wide
                        variety of good bacteria in our gut, which creates a strong defense line between us and the
                        environment, improves our immune system, and strengthens our long-term health.
                        Eat fruits/vegetables of different colors: White (Bananas), Yellow (Pineapples, Mango), Orange
                        (Orange, Papaya), Red (Apple, Strawberries, Raspberries, Tomatoes, Watermelon), Green (Avocado,
                        Kale, Lettuce, Cucumber), Purple/Blue (Blackberries, Prunes). Here’s a full list under the color
                        wheel.
                        <br>
                        If you have existing gut problems, be careful about eating excessive amounts of fiber as it may
                        cause digestion and constipation issues.[3] Consume low-fiber foods as you let your gut heal,
                        juice your fruits/vegetables to get their nutrients, and then build up your whole
                        fruit/vegetable intake.

                        10. <b>Cut down on processed food.</b> Processed food is not good because (a) most of the
                        nutritional value
                        is lost in the creation of these foods, and (b) the added preservatives are bad for our health.
                        Many processed foods contain a high amount of salt which leads to higher blood pressure and
                        heart disease. In general, the more ingredients a food has on the label (ending with ‘ite’ or
                        ‘ate’), the more processed it is. Go for less processed food such as a baked potato over chips,
                        fresh fruit over canned fruit, and intact grains over white bread.

                    <p>
                        11. <b>Choose intact grains over refined grains.</b> Intact grains contain all the essential
                        parts of
                        the grain seed; in other words, they contain 100% of the original kernel, which includes the
                        bran, germ, and endosperm. Because these layers are intact, the grain contains a richer
                        nutritional profile of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals than refined grains (which are
                        grains stripped of the bran and germ layers through processing).[4]
                        Go for intact grains like steel cut oats, barley, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, millet. Refined
                        grains include white rice, white flour, most types of bread, white pasta, quick oats, and
                        cereals. The more processing a grain has been through, the more refined it is. If you’re
                        starting out, there’s no need to 100% ban refined grains — moderation is the key. Transition to
                        a more intact-grains-based diet by swapping refined grains with intact grains for 1-2 meals a
                        week and increasing it from there.

                        negative
                        self-image, it naturally weighs down on your mental outlook and health. How much do you love
                        yourself on a scale of 1-10? Why? How can you love yourself more starting today? Read: How To

                    <p>13. <b>Walk/Run barefoot. </b> are many benefits of barefoot walking/running, from having a better
                        posture to less stress for your feet and joints. If the terrain in your neighborhood is too
                        sharp, wear barefoot shoes. </p>
